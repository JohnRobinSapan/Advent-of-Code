## Advent of Code 2023

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, ranging from straightforward algorithmic problems to creative and complex puzzles. It’s a great way to learn, practice, and enjoy the spirit of coding during the holiday season.

The challenges are divided into two parts, each with a different input and output. You can use any programming language or tool to solve them. You can also join a private leaderboard to compete with your friends or colleagues.

The event is free and open to anyone who wants to participate. There are no prizes, except for the satisfaction of solving the puzzles and the admiration of your peers. However, you can donate to support the creator and the event if you wish.

## About Me

I am a passionate learner and enthusiast who is on a Python learning adventure. Advent of Code provides a fantastic opportunity to sharpen my programming skills, explore new Python features, and embrace problem-solving in a fun and festive way.

You can explore each day’s solution by navigating into the corresponding day’s directory. The Python scripts are named in a way that reflects the day and challenge.
